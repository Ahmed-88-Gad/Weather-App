Weather-Journal App Project
Overview
This project create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

Instructions
I modifyed the server.js file and the website/app.js file. 
I made a local server.
the project connects the openwaether api by fetch() through the url and by sending the zip code and retrieved the data i want.
Then i posted that data, the text that user entered and the current date to my local server by using http post request.
And get all that data again using http get request and updating the ui by all that data.
